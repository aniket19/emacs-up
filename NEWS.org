* v0.1.0
  This initial version of ~emacs-up~ is built around ~package.el~
  which is the default package management system for Emacs.

  However, a number of people within Helpshift are working on projects
  which need to support Clojure versions below 1.7 (eg: projects which
  depend on the Storm framework). Versions of CIDER - The Clojure
  Interactive Development Environment that Rocks - which are available
  in public package repositories do not support these older Clojure
  versions.

  Future development of ~emacs-up~ will move to ~el-get~, which allows
  the developers to pin the version of the emacs package that they
  want to install.
